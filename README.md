save_imagefiles_from_imageurls.py
======
**imagefiles_from_imageurls.py** is a script for downloading images from 
a list of urls and saving them to file.  Both the urls and filenames must

An example is included for demonstration purposes.  It downloads two different
types of sum images from the spaceweather website:
